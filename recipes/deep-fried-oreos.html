        <p>Oreos dipped in pancake butter and fried!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup pancake mix</li>
            <li>1 (18 ounce) package cream-filled chocolate sandwich cookies (such as OreoÂ®)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Whisk together the egg, milk, and 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a bowl until smooth. 
                Stir in the pancake mix until no dry lumps remain. Dip the cookies into the batter 
                one at a time, and carefully place into the hot frying oil. Fry only 4 or 5 at a time 
                to avoid overcrowding the deep fryer. Cook until the cookies are golden-brown, 
                about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.</li>
        </ol>
